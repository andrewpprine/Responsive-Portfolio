          I strive to utilize my experience and expertise in media, education,
          and technology to create and refine informational tools for a global
          audience.

          As a teacher, I collaborate with multiple resources and teams across a
          variety of fields to design, implement, and evaluate dynamic plans,
          programs, and activities for a range of clients. As a photographer, I
          possess critical observation skills, an impeccable attention to
          detail, and a keen analysis for client habits and interests. As a
          journalist, I am personally dedicated to tracking developments across
          a wide range of topics, utilizing extensive research opportunities to
          maintain sound awareness in an era of rapid information evolution, and
          relating information in the most grammatically accurate manner
          possible. And on a personal level, I am an avid devotee for acquiring
          information, interacting with technology, and driven to provide others
          with the tools to realize capabilities past, present, and future.
